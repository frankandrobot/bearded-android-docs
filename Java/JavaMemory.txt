====== JavaMemory ======
Created Saturday 07 September 2013

* different types of memory: heap and stack
* local variables including arguments are always stored on the stack

* Watch out for static mutable objects---don't store mutable non-threadsafe classes
* Object pooling is in general inefficient unless the objects are very expensive to create. See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp01274/index.html
* Explicit nulling is often bad unless you really will cause a memory leak. (Don't help the GC).
