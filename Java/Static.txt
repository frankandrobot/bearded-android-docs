====== Static ======
Created Sunday 08 September 2013

* static variables are shared by the entire class, not a specific instance (unlike normal member variables)
* static methods are also shared by the entire class
* static classes are inner classes that arenâ€™t tied to their enclosing classes
* static can be used around a block of code in a class to specify code that runs when the virtual machine is first started up, before instances of the class are created.
