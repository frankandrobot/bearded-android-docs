====== Queue ======
Created Tuesday 17 December 2013

The **queue** is a FIFO data structure---first in/first out. Items are put in the end of the queue and are removed from the head of the queue. Think of a line at a bank. 

Java has a Queue<E> interface as well as some concrete classes (not limited to):
* ArrayBlockingQueue
* Linked List

===== How to Implement a Queue using a Stack =====
* A queue is FIFO
* A [[Stack|stack]] is LIFO
* Therefore, you'll need at least two stacks.
* Implement add() in the usual way. Ex: add elements 1,2,3,4 in that order

''Stack A: head -> | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | <-tail''

* To remove() an element, pop the items in Stack A and put them into Stack B:

''Stack B: head -> | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | <- tail''

The items are now in reverse order so you can pop them from Stack B.

* The full add() method pops the items from Stack B onto Stack A before adding the element to Stack A.
