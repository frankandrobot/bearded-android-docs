===== Inheritance vs Composition =====

Summary: there is no better or worse principle. There's only "appropriate" and "inadequate" design for the given task. However, in general, prefer composition.

* Use the [[+LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple]] to determine if you should use inheritance.
* Composition represents a "has a"/"uses a" relationship. Ex: A car has an engine. (Alternatively, does Type B only want some of the methods of Type A?)
* Inheritance is a "behaves likes a" relationship. (Alternatively, does Type B want to use all the public methods of Type A such that Type B can be used wherever Type A is expected?)
