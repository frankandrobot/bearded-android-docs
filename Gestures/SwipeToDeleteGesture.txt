* Use getScaledTouchSlop() to account for different touch screen calibrations (If translation > touch slop, then the phone thinks its a real touch action.)
* To prevent parent views from handling touch views, use ViewParent#requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent. Setting lasts until an UP or CANCEL event.
* See also [[TouchEvents:Gestures]] to figure out how to do event handling properly.
