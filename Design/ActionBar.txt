====== ActionBar ======
Created Saturday 31 August 2013

====== General Organization ======
* App icon (up button)
* View control
* Action buttons
* More button

===== Tips =====
* Use different layouts
* Consider splitting action bar for portrait
* Actions on the bottom in this case
* Use FIT scheme to decide what actions to add
** is the action frequent? 7 out of 10 visits or several times in a row
** is the action important? 
** is the action typical? 
* screen width in dp determines how many icons fit in action bar

    smaller than 360 dp = 2 icons (including more button)
    360-499 dp = 3 icons
    500-599 dp = 4 icons
    600 dp and larger = 5 icons

====== Gotchas ======
As per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11480302/overflow-actions-on-actionbar-not-showing

* If you have a physical menu key, the overflow indicator does not show. That is a behaviour by design. See here for more details on another question asked.
