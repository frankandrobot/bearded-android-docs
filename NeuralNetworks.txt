====== NeuralNetworks ======
Created Friday 15 November 2013

To understand what a neural network is, please see the definition of a [[+Neuron|neuron]] first.

A **single layer** **neural network **is one or more [[+Neuron|neurons]] working together in parallel. A **multi-layer neural network** is two or more single-layer networks working in sequence. 
See [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Artificial_Neural_Networks/Neural_Network_Basics|here]] for diagrams or take a look at the [[+Resources|resources.]] 

Neural networks can be thought of as a function of the input //and //the weights of the neurons. More importantly, if each neuron represents a continuous and differentiable function, then the entire network is a continuous and differentiable function. This property is important for learning. (See [[+BackPropagation]]).
