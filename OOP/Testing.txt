====== Testing ======
Created Friday 27 June 2014

Good testing, again, is based on careful thought and on basic principles of risk management. Risk management is based on statistics and information theory; if the testers (or at least the test manager) don't have at least rudimentary skills in this area, then you are likely to do a lot of useless tests.
