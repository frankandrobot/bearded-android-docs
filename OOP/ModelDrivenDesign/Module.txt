====== Module ======
Created Thursday 23 October 2014

There should be a low coupling between **modules** (or packages) and hi cohesion within them (concepts inside a module should make sense together).

Modules divide the code into //concepts//. The //meaning// of objects being divided needs to drive the choice of modules.

Even though it may be difficult, it makes sense to also refactor modules as the app grows.

If a model tells a story, modules are chapters.
