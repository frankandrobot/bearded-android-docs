====== ServiceObject ======
Created Wednesday 21 January 2015

Some actions in a system warrant a Service Object to encapsulate their operation. I reach for Service Objects when an action meets one or more of these criteria:

The action is complex (e.g. closing the books at the end of an accounting period)
The action reaches across multiple models (e.g. an e-commerce purchase using Order, CreditCard and Customer objects)
The action interacts with an external service (e.g. posting to social networks)
The action is not a core concern of the underlying model (e.g. sweeping up outdated data after a certain time period).
There are multiple ways of performing the action (e.g. authenticating with an access token or password). This is the Gang of Four Strategy pattern.
