====== Delegate ======
Created Wednesday 21 January 2015

also called **mixin**

Basically, a mixin is a form of object composition. Really, a mixin is a way to implement an interface, so it's an alternative too inheritance. That means that you should prefer (proper) object composition to a mixin.

'''
Ex:

class Foo {
    void foo() {}
}

class Bar {
    @Delegate private Foo foo = new Foo()
}
//you can now call
bar.foo()
'''


===== Best Practices =====
* object composition != mixin.  Just because you can easily add a delegate/mixin to an object doesn't mean you should.
* don't forget the Single Responsibility Principle. Before adding a mixin to object, ask if it makes sense for that object to have that property
