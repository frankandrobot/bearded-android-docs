====== UserStory ======
Created Tuesday 20 January 2015

user stories are:
* user's tasks (goal -> task -> tool/features)
* user's need
* product description
* planning item
* token for convo
* mechanism for deferring convo

When used as **acceptance tests **(see [[SystemTest]] ), they are the absolute core functionality without which the story can't be complete. Acceptance tests are usually very hi-level.

===== How to Write a User Story =====
Basic template

'''
As a [type of user]
I want to [perform some task]
so that I can [reach some goal]
'''


* look for alternative tasks
* look for exceptions (what could go wrong and what would user need to do to recover?)
* consider other users

===== Organizing User Stories =====
* interdependent user stories together form a **workflow**
* related stories can be done in parallel
