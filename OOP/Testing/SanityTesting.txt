====== SanityTesting ======
Created Monday 15 December 2014

After receiving a software build, with minor changes in code, or functionality, Sanity testing is performed to ascertain that the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced due to these changes.The goal is to determine that the proposed functionality works roughly as expected. If sanity test fails, the build is rejected to save the time and costs involved in a more rigorous testing.
