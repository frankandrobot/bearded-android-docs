* add a setter method that allows you to replace an object that gets created in the constructor

Unfortunately, this approach has several downsides when you don't use Spring or another [[OOP:InversionOfControl|IoC]] framework:
* You are adding a setter that should be called only in unit tests
* The original dependency is still instantiated
* Breaks encapsulation 

Alternatives
* use an Ioc framework
* use reflection to set the value of the object in the unit test
the design of your class.
