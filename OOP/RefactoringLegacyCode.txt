====== Working Effectively With Legacy Code: Notes ======

Created Tuesday 22 April 2014

===== Chapter 7 - It Takes Forever to Make a Change =====
* minimize dependencies by extracting interfaces

===== Chapter 8 - How Do I Add a Feature? =====
[[TestDrivenDevelopment]]:
0. Get the class you want to change under test.
1. Write a failing test case.
2. Get it to compile.
3. Make it pass. (Leave legacy code unchanged as much as possible)
4. Remove duplication.
5. Repeat.

* use [[ProgrammingByDifference]] up until it makes sense. Ensure [[LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple]] by using a [[NormalizedHierarchy]] and you may have to ultimately use [[ObjectComposition]]
