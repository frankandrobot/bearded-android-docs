There is some argument as to what Inversion of Control means. As per Martin Fowler, Inversion of Control =  Dependency Injection:

The **Inversion of Control** (IoC) (aka **Dependency Injection [DI]**) pattern is about removing dependencies from your code.

'''
public class TextEditor
{
    private ISpellChecker checker;
    public void checkSpelling()
    {
	//...
        checker.check();
	//...
    }
}
'''

The //inversion //is how the code lookups up the ISpellChecker implementation.
There are several ways to achieve dependency injection:

* constructor injection - "inject" the implementation via the constructor
* setter injection - like constructor injection but pass the implementation via a setter
* interface injection
* service locator
