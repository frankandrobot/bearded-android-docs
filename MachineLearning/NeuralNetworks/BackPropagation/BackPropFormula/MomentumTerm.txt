====== MomentumTerm ======
Created Wednesday 16 July 2014

The **momentum term** helps prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local minimums. Note that there is no guarantee that the momentum works but it has been found to work in practice.

===== Notation =====
* Please read the [[NotationPage]] 

===== Calculating the Momentum =====
* Let `w_(kj)^(**(l))` = the value of the weight from the //previous// iteration of the backprop algorithm. 
* If there is no previous value, let `w_(kj)^(**(l)) = 0`.

Then the **momentum term** is

`\ \ alpha w_(kj)^(**(l))`

where `alpha` is the **momentum parameter**.
