====== WeightInitialization ======
Created Thursday 01 May 2014

"Pick the weights from a uniform distribution whose mean is zero and whose variance is chosen to make the standard deviation of the induced local fields of the neurons (See [[NeuralNetworks|neural networks]]) lie at //the transition between the linear and saturated parts of the //activation function" (I have no idea what the emphasized parts means.)

Most researchers initialize the weights to random values between 0 and 1. I use a gaussian with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 1.
