====== BackPropAlgorithms ======
Created Wednesday 16 July 2014

There are actually several types of backpropagation, all based on the method of **gradient descent**.

* **online mode **- weights are updated after each example
* **batch gradient **(or **batch mode**) - weights are updated after going through the entire training set. See [[+BatchModeBackPropagation]].
* **stochastic gradient**
