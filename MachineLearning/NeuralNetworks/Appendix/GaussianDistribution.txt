====== GaussianDistribution ======
Created Tuesday 07 January 2014

A **gaussian distribution **(aka **normal distribution**) is defined by the following probability density function:

`\ f(x) = 1/(sigma sqrt(2 pi)) e^(-(x-mu)^2âˆ•(2sigma^2))`
      
where `mu` is the population mean and `sigma^2` is the variance.

If a random variable X follows the normal distribution, then we write:
          
`\ X ~ N(mu, sigma^2)`

The **standard normal distribution** is a special case of a normal distribution with `mu = 0` and `sigma = 1`.
