====== LagrangeMultipliers ======
Created Sunday 06 April 2014

* http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/LagrangeMultipliers.aspx

* is a way of optimizing a function(s) to given constraints where the contraints are a set of equations or inequalities

The **method of lagrange multiplies **is:

Step 1. Solve the following system of equations.
`\ \ \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g`
`\ \ g = k`

Step 2. Plug in all solutions, `bb x`, from the first step into `f` and identify the minimum and maximum values, provided they exist.

The constant `\lambda` is called the **Lagrange Multiplier**. `f` is the function to optimize and `g` is the constraint.
