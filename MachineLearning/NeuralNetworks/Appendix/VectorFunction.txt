====== VectorFunction ======
Created Monday 06 January 2014

A **vector function** `F` is a function `F:bb R^n -> bb R^m`, typically written in the form

`\ Y = F(X)`, `X in bb R^n`, `Y in bb R^m`

What we actually have here is

`\ ( (y_1), (y_2), (vdots), (y_m) ) = ( (f_1(x_1,...,x_n)), (f_2(x_1,...,x_n)), (vdots), (f_m(x_1,...,x_n)) )`
