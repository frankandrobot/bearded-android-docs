====== NeuralNetworks ======
Created Friday 15 November 2013

A **neural network **is basically a set of [[+Neuron|neurons]] working together in sequence and in parallel. The simplest neural network consists of a single neuron.
{{./diagram.png?type=diagram}}
The diagram above shows a neural network made up of a single [[+Neuron|neuron]] with 3 inputs and 1 output. In its most basic form, each input is multiplied by a neuron //weight//. The output is the sum of these products passed through an //activation function//. See the [[+Neuron|neuron page]] for details.

The next level of complexity is to have neurons in a **layer** work together in parallel.

The diagram above shows a **single layer neural network** with 2 neurons, 3 inputs, and 2 outputs.

The next level of complexity is to have layers work together in sequence. 
{{./diagram002.png?type=diagram}}
This diagram shows a **multi-layer neural network **with:
* 3 inputs
* 1 output
* An input layer with 3 neurons
* An output layer with 1 neuron
* it is **fully connected** because each neuron is connected to all inputs in the previous layer

===== Formal Definition =====
Neural networks can be thought of as a function of the input //and //the weights of the neurons. More importantly, if each neuron represents a continuous and differentiable function, then the entire network is a continuous and differentiable function. This property is important for learning. (See [[+BackPropagation]]).

===== Neural Network Families =====
Unfortunately, a "universal" neural network suitable for any type of problem does //not// exist. There are actually different types of NNs suitable for different types of problems:

* **recursive neural networks** - sentiment analysis (natural language processing)
* [[+ConvolutionalNetwork|convolution networks]] - image processing, handwriting recognition
* [[GraphTransformerNetwork]] (GTN)
* many more
