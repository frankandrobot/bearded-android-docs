====== ActiveMQ ======
Created Wednesday 05 March 2014

[[ActiveMQ]] or **Message Orientated Middleware (MOM)** is used to reliably communicate between two distributed processes. Yes you could store messages in a database to communicate between to processes, but as soon as the message is received you'd have to delete the message. That means a row insert and delete for each message. When you try to scale that up communicating thousands of messages per second, databases tend to fall over.

* They asume that messages in a healthy system will be deleted very quickly
* Can also push messages to consumers

==== Are there different types of message queues? ====
There seems to be only one type of queue. Usually, shops use multiple [[ActiveMQ]] queues each for a different purpose. There are also filters to figure out the type of message on the queue.

==== Whats the largest object a message queue can receive? ====
There's a special API for large files call //Blob Messages //for version 4.2 or later and //JMS Streams// for earlier versions.
* with Blob messages there is no file size limit
* with JMS Streams the file must reside in client-side memory

==== Is there a limit to how many objects a message queue can receive (maximum queue size)? ====
Below version 5, you could run out of memory.
Starting with version 5, [[ActiveMQ]] pages messages to disk.

==== Maximum number of consumers on a message queue? ====
Any number of consumers can point to the queue but only 1 consumer accesses the queue at any given time. As soon as its done, the next consumer accesses the queue.

==== Maximum number of producers on a message queue? ====


==== How do you register a producer? ====

==== How do you register a consumer? ====
