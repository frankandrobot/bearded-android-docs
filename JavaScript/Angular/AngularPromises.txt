====== AngularPromises ======
Created Wednesday 29 October 2014

* http://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2014/02/04/angularjspart-11-promises/ - introduction (but unfortunately uses bad practices)

Traditional approach uses callbacks. This is pretty neat, but, it has some drawbacks; for one, combining or chaining multiple asynchronous processes is tricky; it either leads to a lot of boilerplate code, or what's known as callback hell (nesting callbacks and calls in each other)

When creating custom asynchronous deferred tasks make sure to read [[AngularPromises]]

===== $http =====
* is a special case. You can use #then but it adds extra #success and #error functions. These functions internally return the $http promise

===== Promise Chaining =====
