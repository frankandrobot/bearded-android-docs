====== Gestures ======
Created Tuesday 10 September 2013

When you return a boolean in an event handler method, it determines whether the event is consumed or not.

* If you return true from an ACTION_DOWN event you are interested in the rest of the events in that gesture. A "gesture" in this case means all events until the final ACTION_UP or ACTION_CANCEL. 
* Returning false from an ACTION_DOWN means you do not want the event and other views will have the opportunity to handle it. If you have overlapping views this can be a sibling view. If not it will bubble up to the parent.
