====== LoaderManager ======
Created Saturday 13 July 2013

You will need to implement all of the functions correctly.

You can use an Observer to tell the Loader that the data changed.

* Loader Lifecycle
 + initialized
 + started
 + data generated
 + onLoadFinished
** initLoader
 + if loader is brand new, then init => started => data generated
   => onLoadFinished
 + if loader already exists and data generated, 
   then init => onLoadFinished
** restartLoader
 + if loader is brand new, works just like initLoader
 + otherwise, destroys previous loader before recreating
