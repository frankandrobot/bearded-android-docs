====== AsyncTask ======
Created Thursday 11 July 2013

* The AsyncTask class encapsulates the creation of a background process and the synchronization with the main thread. It also supports reporting progress of the running tasks.
* Android executes AsyncTask tasks in parallel by default before Android 1.6 
* Android executes [[AsyncTask]] tasks in sequence by default as of Android 3.0.
* You can tell Android to run it in parallel with the usage of the executeOnExecutor() method, specifying AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR as first parameter.

===== Big Disadvantage of AsyncTask =====
â€¢ The AsyncTask does not handle configuration changes automatically, i.e. if the activity is recreated, the programmer has to handle that in his coding.

A common solution to this is to declare the AsyncTask in a retained headless fragment.
