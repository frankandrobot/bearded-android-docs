====== Volatile ======
Created Saturday 07 September 2013

* the value of the variable is always stored in the [[JavaMemory:HeapSpace]] and not in the stack
* a write to volatile variable establishes a happens-before relationship with readers. All readers will see the new value of the variable once the writer finishes.

===== When to Use Volatile =====
* To make long and doubles atomic
* Alternative way of doing synchronization
* To tell compiler to NOT do code optimization that is undesirable in multi-threaded environment. Ex: don't cache value in stack
