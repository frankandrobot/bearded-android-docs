===== Build Process =====
Java and C# have a similar build processes.

In Java:

* code JAVA file
* compiler turns JAVA file into CLASS file containing byte code. CLASS files are OS independent.
* JVM interprets CLASS file to platform-specific OS calls. JVMs are OS dependent.
* JIT (just-in-time compilation) happens as the CLASS file is interpreted. JVMs don't turn byte code into native code unless it uses a JIT. Originally, not every JVM used a JIT but nowadays most JVMs use JITs.

In C#:

* code C# file (usually with CS extension)
* compiler turns CS file into //intermediate language (IL)//. IL code and resources is stored in a file called //managed assembly //(EXE or DLL).
* .NET framework (via //common language runtime// or //CLR//) turns assembly into native code using a JIT. Code run by CLR is also called //managed code//. Alternatively, you can use the ngen tool to compile C# directly into native code.
* Language interoperability is a key feature. C#-generated IL code works with IL code generated by .NET VB, Visual C++, and +20 other languages.

==== Common Language Runtime ====
The **common language runtime (CLR)** is the heart of .NET Framework and provides the execution environment for all .NET Framework code. The CLR provides various functions and services required for program execution, including just-in-time (JIT) compilation, allocating and managing memory, enforcing type safety, exception handling, thread management, and security.

The CLR is a virtual machine. The CLR has a set of low-level operations it can perform, a set of memory services, and an assembly language to define executable programs (the intermediate language or IL).
