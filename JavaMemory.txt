====== JavaMemory ======
Created Saturday 07 September 2013

Different types of memory: 
* [[+HeapSpace]] - contains objects (i.e., whenever you use "new" keyword, this is where object goes)
* stack - methods, local variables, and reference variables. Each method call has its own frame on the stack.
* code - bytecode
* static - static data/methods


* Watch out for static mutable objects---don't store mutable non-threadsafe classes
* Object pooling is in general inefficient unless the objects are very expensive to create. See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp01274/index.html
* Explicit nulling is often bad unless you really will cause a memory leak. (Don't help the GC).
