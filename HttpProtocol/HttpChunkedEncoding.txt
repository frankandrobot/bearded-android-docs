If a server wants to start sending a response before knowing its total length (like with long script output), it might use the simple chunked transfer-encoding, which breaks the complete response into smaller chunks and sends them in series. You can identify such a response because it contains the "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header. All HTTP 1.1 clients must be able to receive chunked messages.

A chunked message body contains a series of chunks, followed by a line with "0" (zero), followed by optional footers (just like headers), and a blank line. Each chunk consists of two parts:

a line with the size of the chunk data, in hex, possibly followed by a semicolon and extra parameters you can ignore (none are currently standard), and ending with CRLF.
the data itself, followed by CRLF.
So a chunked response might look like the following:

'''
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

1a; ignore-stuff-here
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
10
1234567890abcdef
0
some-footer: some-value
another-footer: another-value
[blank line here]
'''
