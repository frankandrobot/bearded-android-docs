===== The HEAD Method =====

A HEAD request is just like a GET request, except it asks the server to return the response headers only, and not the actual resource (i.e. no message body). This is useful to check characteristics of a resource without actually downloading it, thus saving bandwidth. Use HEAD when you don't actually need a file's contents.

The response to a HEAD request must never contain a message body, just the status line and headers.

===== The POST Method =====
 OST request is used to send data to the server to be processed in some way, like by a CGI script. A POST request is different from a GET request in the following ways:

* There's a block of data sent with the request, in the message body. There are usually extra headers to describe this message body, like Content-Type: and Content-Length:.
* The request URI is not a resource to retrieve; it's usually a program to handle the data you're sending. The HTTP response is normally program output, not a static file.
