===== Local Receptive Fields  =====
In a fully-connected neural network, each neuron is connected to each input.

When a neuron has a local receptive field, the neuron is connected to a //subset// of the input layer. In a [[ConvolutionalNetwork]], the inputs are arranged in a 2D grid. Each neuron is connected to a square in the input grid.

In the diagram, the input grid is 5 x 5. Neuron `N1` is connected to the inputs marked `X`.

===== Shared Weights =====
In a typical neural network, each neuron has its own set of weights. 

'''
Layer
N1: w11 w12 w13
N2: w21 w22 w23
N3: w31 w32 w33
'''

Here weight w//ij// connects neuron `N_i` to input `x_i`. The w//ij//'s are not necessarily equal---each neuron has its own set of weights. In a CNN, //each neuron in a given layer share a set of common weights.//

Layer
N1: w1 w2 w3
N2: w1 w2 w3
N3: w1 w2 w3

* spatial or temporal subsampling

* unlike a traditional neural networks, CNNs use **feature maps**. A feature map is best explained through an example
