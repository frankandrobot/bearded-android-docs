====== UpdatingTheLearningTerms ======
Created Monday 14 July 2014

For each weight `w_(kj)^((l))`, store the sum of all its [[LearningTerm|learning terms]] for all the training examples, `sum_i Delta w_(kj)^((l))[i]`. You'll use this cumulative sum to adjust the weight. 

**Note:**
1. Wait until you have the total sum `sum_i Delta w_(kj)^((l))[i]` from all the training examples before adjusting the weights. 
2. Its now clear why we needed to store the values of the impulse functions and the gradients---calculating these values dynamically significantly reduces the performance of the algorithm.
