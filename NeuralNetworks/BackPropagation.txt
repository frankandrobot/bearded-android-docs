====== BackPropagation ======
Created Monday 18 November 2013

You may want to first read the [[+Motivation|motivation]] for the back propagation algorithm.

There are actually several types of backpropagation, all based on the method of **gradient descent**.

* **online mode **- weights are updated after each example
* **batch gradient **(or **batch mode**) - weights are updated after going through the entire training set. See [[+BatchModeBackPropagation]].
* **stochastic gradient**
