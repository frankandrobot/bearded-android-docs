Step 1. Initialize the weights.
Step 2. For each training value:
Step 2a. Peform the forward computation.
Step 2b. Perform the backward computation
Step 2c. Repeat steps 2a--2b until the error is smaller than a pre-selected value.

===== Initalizing the Weights =====
"Pick the weights from a uniform distribution whose mean is zero and whose variance is chosen to make the standard deviation of the induced local fields of the neurons (See [[:NeuralNetworks]] ) lie at //the transition between the linear and saturated parts of the +ActivationFunction// " (I have no idea what the emphasized parts means.)

Most researchers seem to initialize the weights to random values between 0 and 1.
