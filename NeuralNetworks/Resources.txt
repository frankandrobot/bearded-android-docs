* http://itee.uq.edu.au/~cogs2010/cmc/chapters/BackProp/ - good overview of neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm
* http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj658979.aspx - good hands-on explanation of the backpropagation algorithm
* http://jeremykun.com/2012/12/09/neural-networks-and-backpropagation/ - really awesome theoretical explanation of the backpropagation algorithm and overrall a very good blog about machine-learning.
* http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/chapter/K7.pdf - good theoretical explanation of the backpropagation algorithm. Alternative proof without calculus (well mostly)
* https://dspace.ist.utl.pt/bitstream/2295/57975/1/licao_20.pdf - gave me the aha! moment for when I finally got training with multiple examples
* http://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/draw-neural-network-diagrams-graphviz/ - how to draw neural networks with Graphviz
