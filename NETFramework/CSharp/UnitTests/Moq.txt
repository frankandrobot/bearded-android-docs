====== Moq ======
Created Friday 18 April 2014

* can mock instances of classes only
* mocks ''virtual ''methods only
* mocks ''protected'' methods but you lose LINQ compile-time checks
* can mock any method in an interface
* to mock ''static'' methods/classes see [[Moles]]
* "workarounds" exist to mock [[CSharp:ExtensionMethods]] but you need to change the source code. See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562129/how-do-i-use-moq-to-mock-an-extension-method|here]]
