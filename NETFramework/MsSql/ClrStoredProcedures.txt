====== ClrStoredProcedures ======
Created Friday 24 January 2014

**Note: **You need to set up [[ClrIntegration]] first.

A **CLR stored procedure** or **SP** is a stored procedure written in a .NET language (like C#). SPs access the SQL server but do not have to run on the SQL server.

===== SPs vs T-SQL Stored Procedures =====
Short answer:
* it depends

Slightly longer, incomplete answer for SQL 2008:
* If your logic mostly includes transformations of massive sets of data, which can be performed using set operations, then use TSQL.
* If your logic mostly includes complex computations of relatively small amounts of data, use CLR.

CLR stored procedures are for two main things:
1. interaction with the OS, such as reading from a file or dropping a message in MSMQ.
2. performing complex calculations, especially when you already have the code written in a .NET language to do the calculation. CLRs are specially good at working with regular expressions.
