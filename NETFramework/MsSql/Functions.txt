====== Functions ======
Created Friday 21 March 2014

===== Scalar Functions =====
In general, **scalar functions are bad**. See http://sqlblog.com/blogs/hugo_kornelis/archive/2012/05/20/t-sql-user-defined-functions-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-part-1.aspx. The problem boils down to the fact that the optimizer doesn't know how to optimize queries invoking scalar functions.

The workaround is to convert a scalar function to return a table. See http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2006/08/04/scalar-functions-inlining-and-performance-an-entertaining-title-for-a-boring-post.aspx. 

===== Table-Valued Functions =====

In general, you want to use inline table-valued functions. See http://sqlmag.com/t-sql/inline-vs-multistatement-table-valued-udfs

See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2554333/multi-statement-table-valued-function-vs-inline-table-valued-function|here]] for examples of how to create table-valued functions
